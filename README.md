## How ICO works?

### Abstract

The repo presents a simple combination of solidity and javascript.
It's composed of ERC20 for a Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in solidity and front-end html page with web3.js and Vue.js.
To run this demo, you should install...

1. node
2. Ganachi CLI

and I would tell how to run virtual nodes on your computer so that you can operate the demo on the front-end.
